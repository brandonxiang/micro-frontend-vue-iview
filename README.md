This is a demo for micro frontend powerby vue-cli3.0 and iview.

It is inspired by single-spa. However, single-spa is not the best solution for micro-frontend. It seens to be a meta frontend framework without the ability of independent deployment. Partically, how to seperate a huge spa system to independent web apps is the main problem.
